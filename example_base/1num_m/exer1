Answer the following questions:
endstatement

question
The "Country" variable is:
. a numerical continuous variable.
. a numerical discrete variable.
. an absolute frequency.
. a relative frequency.
; None of the above options is correct. 
answer
It is a categorical variable, despite the fact that is is codified
with numbers. Numbers in this case are just labels for the country name.
endanswer
endquestion

question
Organize the data in a frequency table. What values does the variable have?
. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
. 1950,1954,1958,1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990,
1994, 1998, 2002.
. 1, 2, 3, 5.
. It does not take values. 
: None of the abofe options is correct. 
answer
The variable is "Country" and it can have values that go from 1 to 7, 
corresponding to the 7 countries mentioned in the sample. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
In this data set, an individual is...
. A country. 
. A year. 
. A number between 1 and 7. 
. A number between 1 and 5.
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
A country, and its frequency is how manyt times it has won the World Cup. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The statement "a 86\% of the countries has won the World Cup no more 
than 2 times since 1950" is referring to:
. An absolute frequency. 
. A relative frequency. 
. A cumulative absolute frequency. 
. A cumulative relative frequency.
; None of the above options is correct. 
answer
It is clearly not an absolute frequency, since a percentage is given. But
furthermore it is not a cumulative frequency either, since cumulative 
frequencies make only sense for numerical variables, where the values of 
the variable can be ordered and its frequencies accumulated. Therefore
none of the options is correct. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
To represent this distribution graphically, one can use:
. A bar diagram.
. A histogram.
. A stem-and-leaf plot.
. An approximate drawing.
: None of the above options is correct.
answer
The most appropiate graphical representation for a categorical variables is 
a bar diagram
endanswer
endquestion

question
To describe this distribution one has to comment:
. A comparison between the percentage of times that countries have one 
the World Cup. 
. The center and the spread.
. The form and extreme values, if any. 
. The center, the spread, the form and extreme values, if any. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
Being a categorical variable, there is only one appropiate numerical summary: 
the proporton or percentatge of cases in each category.
