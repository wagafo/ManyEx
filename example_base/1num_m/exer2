question
The fourth observation, in the ordered list of cases from the smallest to 
the largest value, is:
. 35
. 4
. 12
. 17
; None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The fourth observation is 11, therefore no option is correct. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The center of the distributio is:
. 22 euros
. Between 17 and 22 euros
. 12 euros
. 49 euros
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
Since there are 15 cases (an uneven number of cases), there is a 
case which lies exactly in the center, the 8th case. We check the 
ordered list and we see that this cas has a value equal to 22. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The form of the distribution is:
. Skewed to the right. 
. Perfectly symmetric. 
. Skewed to the left. 
. It does not have a form. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
If there weren't some unusually high values, the distribution would be 
more symmetric, therefore we have skewness to the right (to high values). 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The distribution
. has an outlier equal to 86.
. does not have outliers.
. has two outliers equal to 4 and 5.
. has one outlier equal to 49. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The case with a value equal to 86 is clearly isolated from the rest and 
therefore we can consider it an outlier.
endanswer
endquestion

question
The leaf unit is equal to 
. 1.
. 10.
. 100.
. euro cents.
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The values that we observe in the plot are equal to the actual values 
in euros, therefore the leaf unit is equal to 1.
