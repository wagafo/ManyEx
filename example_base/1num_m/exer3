question
In this data set, an individual is
. A country.
. A number between 4 and 14. 
. A poverty percentage. 
. A year. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The cases that we have in our sample correpond to countries for which we
observe a characteristic, the percentage of poor people (according
to the poverty line criterium). Therefore the individuals are countries. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The variable `Poverty percentage'' is:
. Numerical.
. Categorical continuous.
. Categorical. 
. Categorical discrete. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
It is a numerical variable, we quantify the percentage of poor people for 
each country.

question

Draw a stem-and-leaf plot for this distribution (do not round the 
leafs or split the stems). The number of stems in the diagram that 
you get is:
. 10
. 8
. 11
. Less than 8
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The stem-and-leaf plot is the following


\bigskip

\tthdump{
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\epsfxsize=40pt
\epsfbox{stem2.eps}
\end{center}
}
%%tth:\begin{html}<p><img SRC="stem2.jpg" height=300 width=250></center>\end{html}

There are 10 stems in the diagram.
endanswer
endquestion

question
According to the stem-and-leaf plot, the center of the distribution is:
. 9.8
. Between 8 and 9
. 10.3
. 11.2
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The center is defined as the case which is larger than 50\% of the cases
and smaller than 50\%. Since there is an uneven number of cases (11), at
the plot it will correspond with the case in the 6th place, that is 9.8.

# Now we allow for the last two questions to permute, but they will be
# always located at the end.

question

We want now to reduce the number of stems to only 2 stems. To achieve this,
we will have to:
. round and split the stems in 2.
. round.
. split the stems in 2. 
. split the stems in 5.
: none of the above options is correct. 
answer
Rounding to the tens, we get two stems (0 and 1), therefor to get 4 stems we 
have to split then afterwards in 2. Therefore the correct answer is 
round and split in 2. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The form of the distribution is:
. Skewed to the left. 
. Quite symmetric. 
. Skewed to the right. 
. Neither symmetric nor skewed. 
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
There are some small values that break the symmetry of the distribution, 
therefore the distribution is skewed to the left.
