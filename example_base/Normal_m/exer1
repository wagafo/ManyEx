title "Rainfall in Catalunya"
block (type=multiplechoice rearrange=yes)
statement
During the last 50 years, yearly average rainfall follows an 
approximately normal distribution with mean equal to 20 l/m$^2$
and a standard deviation of 3 l/m$^2$. 
endstatement
question
What's the percentage of years that has rained more than 23 l.?
. Un 16\%
. Un 32\%
. Un 22\%
. Un 24\%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
According to the rule 100 - 68=32\% of the frequencies are outside the 
limit of the mean plus/minus one standard deviation. Looking at only
one side of the distribution we have 32/2=16\%. 

We can also compute the percentage standardizing $X$:

\[ {{23 - 20} \over {3}} = 1 \]

Looking at the table of standard normal we get that the proportion of 
frequencies lying ot the right of $z=1$ is approximately 16\%. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
What is the approximate maximum rainfall of the 2.5\% of years with less 
rain?
. 14 l/m$^2$
. 12 l/m$^2$
. 16 l/m$^2$
. 10 l/m$^2$
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
This can computed with the rule, since the mean plus/minus 2 standard 
deviations leaves 5\% of the frequencies outside the limits, looking at 
only one side we have 2.5\%, therefore $20 - 2\cdot 3=14$.

We can also look at
the table of the standard distribution, we find that 2.5\% of the 
frequencies are on the left of $z=-1.96$, so we recover the corresponding 
$X$: 

\[ X = 20 - 1.96 \cdot 3 = 14.12 \]
endanswer
endquestion
  
question
What approximate percentage of years has rained less than 16 l.?
. 9.18 \%
. 12.34 \%
. 14.93 \%
. 6.12 \%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
We standardize:

\[ {{ 16 - 20}\over{3}} = -1.33 \]

The percentage of frequencies on the left (smaller values)
 of $z=-1.33$ in the standard normal table is: 9.18\%.
endanswer
endquestion
  
question
What is the approximate maximum rainfall of the 25\% years with less rain?
. 18 l/m$^2$
. 22 l/m$^2$
. 25 l/m$^2$
. 15 l/m$^2$
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
We look for the $z$ in the standard normal table that leaves 25\% of the 
frequencies to the left, and we get $z=-0.67$. We recover $X$:

\[ 20 - 0.67 \cdot 3 = 17.99 l/\mbox{m}^2 \]
endanswer
endquestion

question
What is the approximate percentage of years that has rained between 
14 and 23 l/m$^2$?
. 82.5 \%
. 24 \%
. 18.5 \%
. 15 \%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
According to other questions, 2.5\% of the days it rains less than 14 l/m$^2$ 
and 16\% of days it rains more than 23 l/m$^2$, therefore between these
to limits it rains:

\[ 100 - 2.5 - 16 = 82.5 \mbox{\%} \]
of the days.

question
What should be the approximate shape of the rainfall distribution so that
the computations done in this exercise are valid?
. symmetric
. skewed to the left
. skewed to the right
. bimodal
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The computations here are valid if the underlying distributin is normal, and 
the normal distribution is symmetric.
