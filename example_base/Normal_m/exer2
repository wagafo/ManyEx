title "Duration of the Data Analysis class"
block (type=multiplechoice rearrange=yes)
statement

The duration of the Data Analysis class follows an approximately normal 
distribution with mean equal to 120 minutes and standard deviation equal
to 2 minutes. 
endstatement
question
What is the approximate percentage of classes that last more than 126
minutes?
. Un 0.15 \% 
. Un 1.5 \%
. Un 15 \%
. Un 99.7 \%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
This corresponds to the mean plus three times the standard deviation, 
and therefore according to the 68-95-99.7\% rule 0.3\% of the frequencies
are left out of these limits on both sides of the distribution, looking 
only at one side (the largest values) we get 0.3/2 = 0.15\%. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
What is the approximate minimum duration of the 2.5\% of shortest classes?
. 116 minutes
. 106 minutes
. 126 minutes
. 96 minutes
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
Using the rule, 120 - 2*2 = 116 minutes.
endanswer
endquestion
  
question
What approximate percentage of classes last less than 117 minutes?
. 6.68 \%
. 12.34 \%
. 9.12 \%
. 14.93 \%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
We standardize:

\[ X = {{117 - 120}\over{2}} = -1.5 \]

Looking at the table of the standard normal, we find that for $z=-1.5$ a
6.68\% of the frequencies are smaller. 
endanswer
endquestion
  
question
What is the approximate maximum duration of the 10\% of longest clases?
. 122.56 minutes
. 132.56 minutes
. 142.56 minutes
. 92.56 minutes
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
The corresponding standard $z$ is 1.28, so we recover $X$:

\[ 120 + 1.28 \cdot 2 = 122.56\]
endanswer
endquestion

question
What is the approximate percentage of classes that last between
116 and 120 minutes?
. 47.5 \%
. 24 \%
. 36 \%
. 16 \%
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
2.5\% are shorter than 116 minutes, and 50\% are larger than 120 minutes 
(since it is the mean and by symmetry also the median), therefore:

\[ 100 - 50 - 2.5 = 47.5\]
endanswer
endquestion

question
What is the approximate duration of a class with standardized duration 
equal to 1?
. 122 minutes
. 132 minutes
. 112 minutes
. 142 minutes
: None of the above options is correct. 
answer
Since it is one standard deviation above the mean (mean = 0 , standard 
deviation = 1), we get:

\[ 120 + 2 = 122 \]
endanswer
endquestion
