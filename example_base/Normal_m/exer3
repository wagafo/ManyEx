title "Noise in the street"
block (type=multiplechoice rearrange=yes)
statement
The noise at the crossing of the Balmes and Aragó streets in Barcelona 
has been recorded during 50 days and it has been determined that 
the level of noise follows an approximately normal distribution with mean
equal to 20 deciBels and a standard deviation equal to 1 deciBel. 
endstatement


question
What is the approximate number of days during the period of 50 days recorded 
where the noise level is equal or larger than 21.28 deciBel?
. 5 days
. 10 days
. 15 days
. 2 days
: None of the above optins is correct. 
endquestion

question
What is the approximate percentage of days were the noise is less than 19
deciBels?
. 16 \%
. 20 \%
. 10 \%
. 90 \%
: None of the above optins is correct. 
endquestion
  
question
What is the approximate percentage of days when the noisce is larger than
22 deciBels?
. 2.5\%
. 0.5 \%
. 5 \%
. 95 \%
: None of the above optins is correct. 
endquestion
  
question
What is the approximate percentage of days where the noise level lies
between 19.5 and 20.5 deciBels?
. 38,30 \%
. 48,30 \%
. 28,30 \%
. 18,30 \%
: None of the above optins is correct. 
endquestion

question
On a day with standardized normal level of -1, is there more or less noise
than the median of the distribution?
. Less.
. We do not have enough information to answer the question.
. There is the same noise
. More. 
: None of the above optins is correct.

deciBels, the mean of the standardized distribution
. does not change. 
. increases.
. decreases.
. it becomes negative.
