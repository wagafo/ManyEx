title "Normal Distribution"
block (type=shortanswer rearrange=yes)
statement
The factory "Mantecados S.R.L." manufactures Christmas sweets in 
the traditional way, employing 1,000 workers. The management knows
that each worker produces a mean of 50 kgs of sweets, with a 
standard deviation  of 3 kgs, and that this distribution is 
approximately normal. 
endstatement

question 
What percentage of workers produces less than a worker with
a standardized production equal to 0.45?
answer
We have to look at the table of the standard normal distribution and 
see what proportion of frequencies is reported to the left of 0.45. The 
result is 66.36\%. 
endanswer
endquestion

question 
The management wants to give a prize to all the workers who 
achieve a production of more than 57 kgs a day, and assigns a 
budget for the prize of 10,000 euros. How much will each winning
worker get?
answer
To see what percentage of workers produce more than 57 kgs we 
standardize $X$:

\[ X = {{ 57 - 50} \over {3}} = 2.33 \]

The percentage of frequencies to the right of $z=1$ is 1\%, over 1,000 
workers this represents 10 workers. Since there is a budget of 10,000 euros,
each of the 10 workers will get 1,000 euros. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
The less productive workers will be moved to the packing department.
If all workers producing less than 43 kgs per day are moved, how many
workers will be moved to the packing department?
answer
We standardize again:

\[ X = {{ 43 - 50} \over {3}} = -2.33 \]

The percentage of frequencies to the left of $z-2.33$ is 1\%, therefore 
over 1,000 workers a 1\% represents 10 workers. 
endanswer
endquestion
