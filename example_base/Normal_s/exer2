title "Normal Distribution"
block (type=shortanswer rearrange=no)
statement
The family business "Drink Team" produces grapes for wine, employing
1,000 workers. The management knows that each worker collects a mean 
of 50 kgs of grapes, with a standard deviatin of 3 kgs and the distribution
is approximately normal. 
endstatement

question
What percentage of workers produce less than a worker with 
standardized procution of 0.45?
answer
We look at the table of the standard normal distribution and we 
find that for $z=0.45$ (this is the percentage of frequencies to the 
left of this value of $z$) the corresponding value is 0.6736. Therefore
a 67.36\% of workers will produce les than a worker with standardized
value of 0.45.
endanswer
endquestion

question
Workers producing more than 57 kgs will be rewarded, and there is a budget
of 1,000 euros for the rewards. How much will a rewarded worker get?
answer
We standardize: 

\[ z= (57-50)/3=2.33. \]

Checking the table, we observe that a 1\% of the frequencies are on the
right of 2.33, therefore 1\% of the workers will be rewarded. Over 1,000
workers a 1\% corresponds to 10 workers. Since the budget is of 1,000 euros,
each rewarded worker will get 100 euros. 
endanswer
endquestion

question
Less productive workers will be moved to the packing section. If all
workers producing less than 43 kgs will be moved to packing, how many
workers will be moved?

answer
We standardize:

\[ z= (43-50)/3=-2.33. \]

At the table we observe that to the left of this value we have 1\% of the 
frequencies, therefore over 1,000 this represents 10 workers.
