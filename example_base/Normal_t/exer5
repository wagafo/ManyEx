question
: If to a variable that follows the normal distribution we substract its 
mean, the resulting variable will continue being normal and its 
standard deviation will be equal to 0. 
answer
False, a transformation implying a simple origin change (adding or 
substracting the mean) will not affect the spread (which is measured by the 
standard deviation).
