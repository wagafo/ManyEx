# This is a test description file for "manyex"
#
# To create the normal LaTeX exams give the command
#
#    manyex -n -f file-name
#
# where file-name is the name of this file.
# 
# This will create "exam".tex and "answer".tex, 
# where "exam" and "answer" are the prefixes 
# that you choose below (if not defined the pre-
# fixes will be actually "exam" and "answer"). 
#
# It also creates mn-correct, a text file where
# each line starts with the exam number (001, 002,
# ...) followed by the correct answers for each 
# question (A,B,C... for # multiplechoice, A=true, 
# B=false for true/false and just A's for short-
# answer), and mn-logfile with information on
# the tasks done by manyex. 
#
# Then compile the latex file with latex, for
# instance
# 
#   latex exam.tex
#
# You can also complile the answer file if you
# want to distribute the answers after the exam. 
# The output will contain all generated exams. 
#
# Look at mn-logfile after each run for possible
# errors.

# Set random seed 
# If you change this number the tests created

# the same sequence of exams, if needed. 
seed 8726

# Set first serial number (exam numbering).

# Define exercise types and how many exercises are required 
# per type. The first argument is an integer expressing 
# how many exercises of this type are to be included in the
# exam. There should be enough exercises of this type in the 
# corresponding subdir of the exercise database (or subdirs, 
# more than one can be specified). The second argument 
# specifies (between quotes) the name of the subdir where
# the exercises are contained within the exercise database. 
# More than one subdir can be speficied:
# use 3 from "1num_1", "1num_2"
# for instance. 

# exercise/endexercise lumps all true/false questions together 
# and puts a header "Exercise 1" in front of them, otherwise each
# true/false question would be indexed: "Exercise 1 - Question 1", 
# "Exercise 2 - Question 2"... and so on. 

# We now include the rest of exercises
use 1 from "1num_m"

# Total number of exams to create, you can create as many exams
# as you want, they will be all different unless you have very 
# few exercises in the database and you request a lot of exams
