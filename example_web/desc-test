# This is a test description file for "manyex"
#
# To create the html form exams give the command
#
#    manyex -w -f file-name
#
# where file-name is the name of this file.
#
# This will create "exam"N.tex and "answer"N.tex, 
# where "exam" and "answer" are the prefixes 
# that you choose below (if not defined the pre-
# fixes will be actually "exam" and "answer") and
# N is a correlative number from 0 to total exams 
# being created minus one. 
#
# To create the web form exams (or answers if you 
# want to show them in the web) pass the LaTeX
# code through "tth" (http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/). 
#
# It also creates mn-correct, a text file where
# each line starts with the exam number (001, 002,
# ...) followed by the correct answers for each 
# question (A,B,C... for # multiplechoice, A=true, 
# B=false for true/false and just A's for short-
# answer), and mn-logfile with information on
# the tasks done by manyex. 
#
# Look at mn-logfile after each run for possible
# errors.

# Define exercise types and how many exercises are required

# more than one can be specified). The second argument

# use 3 from "1num_1", "1num_2"
# for instance. 

# exercise/endexercise lumps all true/false questions together
